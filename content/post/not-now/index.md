description: "Does God answer prayers? Sometimes it doesn't feels like it."
---
I've had times, where I felt hopeless. My bubble of a dream burst - just like that.
The plans I've made for my life, the things I wanted to achieve - all gone.

*All gone.*

* * *

In those moments, I've prayed. 

Not the "God is great, God is good, let us thank him for his food, Amen." type of deal.

I've poured out my heart. I have said everything that depressed me. I cried. I screamed.

And then: Nothing. I've felt nothing change, no voice in my head, just nothing.

That had me perplexed. I felt this warmth.

Even though the bubble is still burst, I am suddenly happy.

God told me, "not now". I have to wait, but I know, it is God's plan.
And he knows what he's doing.

He answers prayers, but not always the way we expect him to.
