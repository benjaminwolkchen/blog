I have a blog. Not this one, I built and maintain a german blog about christianity: [awesomeBible](https://awesomebible.de).

Besides writing for the blog, there are a million different things I have to do.
I live in Germany, so I have to have an Imprint and a Privacy Policy and they need to be kept up to date with latest regulations.

On top of that, there are things that I have to manage like social media accounts and the like.

*This is now a rant on how ðŸ’© Facebook is:*
