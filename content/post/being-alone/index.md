I enjoy being alone. I'm not antisocial, but I need my alonetime, sometimes more than others.
In this time, I listen to music, enjoy nature and just process my thoughts.

Often I find myself with thoughts and worries polluting my brain. If everything gets to much, I take a break.

Then I go outside, to a lake nearby. Then, I only listen to calm music, the chirping of the birds and the flow of the river.
It's those moments where my brain clears out.

It's those moments where I bring my thoughts and worries before God.
Sometimes it's a quiet prayer, other times I shout and cry.

I don't have to change, to be heard by God. I don't have to hide anything. He knows it anyway, and if I feel like crying or shouting, I cry and shout.

It's those moments where my brains clears out. The worries become smaller - I know, I don't have to worry anymore.
It's those moments, where I know, I may be alone, but I'm never lonely.

He's there for me.
