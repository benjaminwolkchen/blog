I'm the kind of person that always has music playing in the background.
I can still remember me being introduced to music. As funny as it sounds, because music is such a abstract thing, its true.
My sister brought me a fake beats bluetooth speaker from turkey. My brother wanted to sound-test it and played ["About a Mile - Trust you all the way"](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FMFn3cJTlIM) on it.

I liked that song so much, that I kept listening to it on the speaker.
I can't really reconstruct the exact timeline on what happened when, but my other brother played ["All I need is you"](https://youtu.be/6iRTBh1gCjk) and ["Tell the World"](https://youtu.be/Yc8x33lAnAk) from Lecrae. Both songs, I added to my - *nonexistent*, at the time - playlist.

My music taste comes in waves. For a long time, I liked acoustic songs. My music taste developed more and more into EDM and electronic music.

I like gangster rap but I can't play it in the background. If I take the time to listen to one song, I feel it. But I can't have it playing in the background.

By the way, right now - while I write this article - I listen to Matthew Parkers album "Adventure" (on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3CtdMXnK53iu83nh1vpdkz) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUwB9IKJN4&list=PLzgzXgk47Eh4NJcLx1xMnS6MvUzVnTZ4X)).

I'm the guy who pays attention to the lyrics of a song, so if I hear something I don't like, I can't hear that song anymore.

My favorite song currently is "Burn like embers" also by Matthew Parker, but I really like almost all of his music. The guy rocks.
