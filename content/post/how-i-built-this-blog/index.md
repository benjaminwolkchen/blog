I always wanted to blog but I never really found the setup that worked for me.
In the past, I've used WordPress.com, I've used Hashnode and Ghost but nothing really kept me writing - so I didn't write anything for a long time.

After I read a few `#100DaysToOffload` posts, I wanted to challange myself and start a blog. (Btw, you should check out the blogs of [joelchrono12](https://joelchrono12.ml) and [Kev](https://kevq.uk). They're awesome!)
I got the domain `darkshark9k.ml` and set up this blog with Hugo.

My opinion is, blogs should have a comments section or some sort of feedback space.
For the comment sections on this blog, I use [CactusComments](https://cactus.chat) which is a comment provider using matrix as the comments store.

That's it. Thank you for reading day one of [#100DaysToOffload](https://darkshark9k.ml/tags/100daystooffload/).
