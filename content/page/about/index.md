Hey! My name is Benjamin. ðŸ‘‹

I'm sixteen years old and I am interested in the web, linux and tech in general.
I somethimes develop web applications using Vue and Tailwind.

I do hobby photography. You can find some of my photos [here](https://darkshark9k.ml/categories/photos/) and on [Pixelfed](https://pixey.org/@benjamin).
