In between a flat land and vast mountain ranges live the most endangered and protected animals on earth - in the Kruger National Park.

The Kruger National Park houses a large amount of mammals, reptiles, insects and fishes on a plane of over 19 thousand square kilometers.
The most famous of them are the "Big 5": Leoparts, Buffalos, Rhinos, Elephants and Lions.

Kruger National Park has a lenghty history. The park started in 1926, twenty eight years after the area was declared a nature reserve.

The park was named after Paul Kruger - he was president of the South African Republic at the time. The park was created with the goal of protecting and conserving the South African wildlife.

The first three tourists came into the park in 1926, one year after that, guides were hired and fences were put up.

Today, more than a million visitors come to visit the park every year.
